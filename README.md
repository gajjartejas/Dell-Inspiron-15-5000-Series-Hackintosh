## TLDR; Don't buy DW1820A, Buy DW1550 or DW1560 

A comment from reddit thread: 
>  None of intel wifi cards are supported on hackintoshes. I use dell dw1510 card for mine and my mothers latitude. Probably a good choice would be a dw1550 or dw1560 card or google for a compatible non intel card.

> WiFi is headache. Recently I have brought Dell DW1820A wireless M.2 adaptor from AliExpress but sadly not properly working with Mojave. Generally DW1820A is 3 types of card available. I choose wrong part no, which is not working properly. There are kernal panic with it.
There are other card available but it is expensive.
So recently I have ordered correct part from AliExpress. I will check when it arrives probably with in a day.[Reddit thread ink](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/c7zcv5/dell_inspiron_15_5000_series_mojave_success/esk8ogb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

> I asked to send me the version with serial number CN-OVW3T3. When configuring Hackintosh, it turned out that the subsystem code is 1028: 0023 (typical for CN-08PKF4), not 1028: 0021. The adapter turned on 2 times, saw the network, but hung up after 5 minutes, which is also characteristic of the CN-08PKF4 series modules. MAC address does not match the one indicated on the label. This product is tampered with and does not work.[Reddit thread ink](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/c7zcv5/dell_inspiron_15_5000_series_mojave_success/esr2qlm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
